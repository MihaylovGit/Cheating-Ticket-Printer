    <h1>Cheating The Ticket Printer</h1>
    <p>
      Bus drivers found a "creative" way to cheat the fiscal printers by opening
      their paper lid before the ticket is completely printed, thereby forcing
      the printer to start printing the ticket again. The printer was assuming
      it was out of paper so it started printing the ticket from the beginning.
      This way drivers sold the same ticket multiple times to multiple customer
      stealing the money for these tickets.
    </p>
    <p>
      The company discovered the trick a couple of months later after inspecting
      a video feed. Fortunately each line printed was recorded on the memory of
      the printer so we are able to analyze it and discover how much money each
      driver stole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your task is to analyze the printer output and provide the number of
      duplicate sales and net impact. Note that first sale is legitimate, every
      next sale counts as duplicate. Each ticket may have a different price
      depending on the line and bus stop.
